# Eat-Da-Burger (I Like Big Buns)

### Overview

Deployed version available [here](https://protected-sands-64292.herokuapp.com/).

This simple app is a burger logger created using MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM. It was primarily created for practice using the MVC design pattern. Node and MySQL are used to query and route data in the app, and Handlebars is used to generate the HTML.

### Usage
Users can either eat or delete any burgers listed in the "Uneaten Burgers" box. Burgers that are eaten are moved into the "Devoured Burgers" box. Users can also add new burgers using the input at the bottom of the page.
